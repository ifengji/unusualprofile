# unusualprofile

This package provides a new method to interpret individual results of psychological test batteries. The Mahalanobis distance is a commonly-used measure of how unusual an individual’s profile of scores is compared to a population of score profiles. In models in which there is a set of predictors and a set of dependent variables (e.g., cognitive abilities predicting academic abilities), it is useful to distinguish between a profile of dependent scores that is unusual because its profile of predictor scores is unusual and a profile of dependent scores that is unusual even after controlling for the predictors. The conditional Mahalanobis distance measures the unusualness of a profile shape after controlling for a set of predictors. In psychological assessments, one only has access to observed scores, but the goal is to understand a person’s profile of latent construct scores. Factor score estimates are calculated and used to form conditional Mahalanobis distance with predicted unusualness.
